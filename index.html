				<h2>About Me</h2>
			</header>

			<p>I am a data-driven professional with a strong foundation in financial services and computer science. My
				academic experience provided me with a solid understanding of the asset management industry, financial
				data analytics, computer systems, and computer graphics, while also giving me hands-on exposure to SQL,
				Python, C++, and full stack web development. I have applied these skills in projects involving full
				population audit testing, data reconciliation, web scraping with Selenium, ray tracing, reverse
				engineering, and simple game development.
			</p>


			<!-- Akademiker -->
			<h3> Academic Lineage</h3>
			<p>I am a graduate and 'double husky' of <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/"> Northeastern
					University</a>, where I earned a
				<a href="https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/"> Bachelor of Science in Business Administration </a>
				from September 2017 to May 2021. My coursework included Investments, Fixed-Income Securities, Financial
				Data Analytics, Corporate Finance, and Business Statistics. From January 2022 to May 2024, I completed a
				<a href="https://khoury.northeastern.edu/"> Master of Science in Computer Science. </a>
				Coursework included Algorithms, Computer Systems, Software Vulnerabilities, and a few Computer Graphics
				courses taught by <a href="https://www.mshah.io/">Professor Mike Shah</a>. My coursework taught me a
				range of programming languages and experience working with technologies such as raytracing, reverse
				engineering, full stack development with RESTful APIs, web scraping, and data analytics among others.
				During my academic career, I was involved with various on-campus organizations, including the Mascot
				team, NU Symphony Orchestra, and a fraternity where I served as Secretary.
			</p>

			<!-- Arbeit -->
			<h3> Professional Work Experience</h3>
			<p>As an Audit Senior Analyst at Fidelity Investments, I have honed my expertise in both operational and IT
				general controls, participating in various audits over the firm's asset management, operations, and
				digital assets groups. I have performed audits on Equity Trading, ETF Operations, Derivatives and
				Collateral Management, Compliance, the commission uses and soft dollar program, and digital asset
				custody teams. My favorite audit was of the Counterparty Research and Analytics team, where we reviewed
				the processes and research performed by credit and quantitative analysts and the risk monitoring team's
				control environment. My prior experience as a Data Reconciliation Specialist at Financial Recovery
				Technologies enabled me to master SQL scripting for efficient data handling and perform detailed
				analyses on trade data, enhancing my ability to identify and resolve data discrepancies. While in
				school, I developed leadership and marketing skills as the school mascot, successfully completed two
				co-ops at Eaton Vance and Wayfair, and served in various part-time marketing roles for the Boston Bruins
				and Boston Red Sox.

			<h2>Personal Projects and Fun</h2>
			<p>I’m always eager to explore new cultures and discover exciting travel destinations, especially those
				surrounded by nature. Beyond traveling, music is a big part of my life—I enjoy both listening to it and
				playing it. For exercise, I like practicing martial arts and working out at the gym. I also have a
				passion for driving, whether it’s on the open road or a virtual track, and in the winter, I love playing
				hockey with friends.
			</p>

			<h3>Travel</h3>
			I have been fortunate to travel to various countries and experience different cultures. I have been to
			most states in the US, but not Hawaii and Alaska (I hope to get there someday soon!)
			<br /><br />
			My international travel experiences include:
			<ul>
				<li>(Caracas) Venezuela 2005</li>
				<li>(Berlin 2018, Stuttgart 2024) Germany</li>
				<li>(Montreal, Mont Tremblant) Canada 2023, 2024</li>
				<li>(London, Newmarket, Cambridge) United Kingdom 2024, 2025</li>
				<li>(Amsterdam) Netherlands 2024</li>
				<li>(Zürich, Lucerne, Interlaken, Lauterbrunnen, Geneva) Switzerland 2024</li>
				<li>(Nice) France 2024</li>
				<li>(Monte Carlo) Monaco 2024</li>
				<li>(Milan, Venice, Rome) Italy 2024</li>
				<li>(London, Bath, Cambridge, Oxford, Milton-Keynes) United Kingdom 2025</li>
			</ul>


			<h3>Music</h3>
			<span class="image right"><img src="images/hsso.jpg" alt="" /></span>
			<p> I have played the violin for over 15 years having performed in various orchestras and
				ensembles. I played in Repertory and Principal divisions at <a
					href="https://www.floridayouthorchestra.org/">Florida Youth Orchestra</a> from 2013-2015. My family
				and I then moved to Texas where I did <a href="https://www.twhsorchestra.org/index.html#/">high
					school orchestra</a> until graduation in 2017. During my undergrad, I played with the Northeastern
				University Symphony Orchestra and during a summer, I had the pleasure to play at Harvard Summer School
				Orchestra with my best friend Andre, where we performed a duet together. It was quite a change from high
				school orchestra, and I will always cherish that summer! Today, I enjoy tutoring students wishing to
				learn the violin.</p>

			<h3>Martial Arts</h3>
			<span class="image right"><img src="images/ata.JPEG" alt="" /></span>
			<p> As a 2nd-degree black belt in Songahm Taekwondo under the <a href="https://www.atamartialarts.com/">
					American Taekwondo Association</a>, I have competed in over fifty tournaments and have taught
				classes to students of all ages. My greatest achievement (so far!) has been earning the title of Florida
				State Champion in three categories: sparring, weapons, and forms. My favorite part of the sport was
				watching my peers and myself grow as martial artists, athletes, and human beings. Some of my friends
				moved on to become World Champions, instructors, and physical therapists. Before moving to Dallas,
				I trained at the UFC Gym in Boston, MA and am currently seeking my next school to train in.</p>

			<h3>Motorsports</h3>
			<span class="image right"><img src="images/f1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
			<p> I grew up playing games like Need for Speed, playing with Hot Wheels, and watching Ferrari race on TV
				with my grandfather. Naturally, when I got behind the wheel for the first time, I was hooked! Though I
				don't currently have a car living in the city of Boston, I still find ways to get my racing fix. In
				2023, I attended the <a href="https://www.formula1.com/"> Formula 1 </a> United States Grand Prix in
				Austin, Texas, and most recently the 2024 Monaco Grand Prix. I'm slated to go back to <a
					href=https://circuitoftheamericas.com/"> Circuit of the Americas </a> for the 2024 WEC Lone Star
				LeMans, a six hour endurance race. When not watching cars go fast, I enjoy playing racing games like <a
					href="https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/"> Gran Turismo 7 </a> and <a href="https://www.iracing.com/">
					iRacing</a>.

			<h3>Hockey</h3>
			<span class="image right"><img src="images/hockey.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
			<p> Coming from high school in the southern United States, I was really looking forward to college football
				games. I failed to realize Northeastern actually cut its football program in 2009. Once I was on campus,
				I learned about the school's world-class hockey program, and when I went to my first hockey game, I was
				hooked. I even had the privilege to skate on the ice for nearly all men's and women's hockey games as
				the mascot during my time at Northeastern. Since then, I felt I owed it to the city of Boston for
				introducing me to the sport, and I became a <a href="https://www.nhl.com/bruins"> Boston Bruins </a>
				fan. Gaining some practice ice skating from my mascot duties, I signed up for a local adult hockey
				league for a few games of pickup a year and sometimes with my friends when the ponds freeze in the
				winter.
